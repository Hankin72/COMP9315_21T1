R: bR = 40
S:  bS = 20
Buffers : N = 25 

calculate minimum cost estimates for the (R â‹ˆ S) operation


a.

First, assuming:
outer table: R
inner table: S

For block nested loop join, 
because: bR=40 > N-2=23
therefore, 

cost = bR + bS*ceil(bR/N-2)
     = 40 + 20*ceil(40/23)
     = 40+ 20*2
     = 80

Here, when B <= 20, ceil(bR/N-2) = ceil(40/N-2) >=2, causing the cost increase.
therefore, the minimum number of buffers B=21.


b.

For sort-merge join, where neither table is sorted initially,

step1: 
cost_R = 2*bR*(1+ceil(log_N-1(bR/N))) 
       = 80*(1+1)
       =160 

cost_S = 2*bS*(1+ceil(log_N-1(bS/N)))
       = 2*20*(1+ceil(log_24(20/25)))
       = 40*(1+0)
       = 40

step2: merge sorted relations' cost is,

cost_m = bR + bS
     = 40+20
     =60

Then, total cost = cost_R+ cost_S + cost_m = 260
and let ceil(log_N-1(bS/N) >= 0, 
we can get when buffers B =19, the ceil(log_N-1(bS/N)>0, 
and when buffers B =20, ceil(log_N-1(bS/N) =0;
therefore, the minimum number of buffers is 20.



c.

For sort-merge join, where R is initially sorted, but S is not.

First, the cost of sorting table R is, 

cost 1 = 2*bS*(1+ceil(log_N-1(bS/N)))
       = 2*20*(1+ceil(log_24(20/25)))
       = 40*(1+0)
       = 40

Second: merge sorted relations' cost is,
cost 2 = bR + bS
       =40+20
       =60
Therefore,
total cost = cost 1 + cost 2
           =  140   + 60
           = 100

For buffers, let temp = ceil(log_N-1(bS/N)) 
when B<=19,  the value log_N-1(bS/N) will be greater than 0, and temp >=1,
therefore, the minimum number of buffers is B=20.


d.

For sort-merge join, where S is initially sorted, but R is not.
First, the cost of sorting table S is,

cost 1 = 2*bR*(1+ceil(log_N-1(bR/N)))

       = 2*40*(1+ceil(log_24(40/25)))
       = 80*(1+1)
       = 160

Second: merge sorted relations' cost is,
cost 2 = bR + bS
       =40+20
       =60
Therefore,

total cost = cost 1 + cost 2
           =   160  + 60
           = 220

For buffers, temp = ceil(log_N-1(bR/N))
let log_N-1(bR/N) <1 , we can get N>6
therefore, the minimum number of buffers B=7.



 

e.

For sort-merge join, where both tables are initially sorted.
First, the cost of sorting R and S is,
costR =0
costS =0 

Second: merge sorted relations' cost is,
cost 2 = bR + bS + costR + costS
       =40+20
       =60
Finally, 
total cost = costR + costS+ cost2 = 60

And the minimum number of buffers N =3, since, two table R and S need two buffers for input, and one buffer for output is needed.
